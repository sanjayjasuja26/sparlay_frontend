              <h4>13. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h4>
              <hr />

              <p>
                Under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“<strong>CCPA</strong>”),
                California residents have certain rights regarding our collection, use and sharing
                of personal information. We do not sell your personal information and will not do so
                in the future without providing you with notice and an opportunity to opt-out of
                such sale, as required by law. We do not offer financial incentives associated with
                our collection, use or disclosure of your personal information.
              </p>
              <p>
                We collect various categories of personal information when you use the Site that may
                include but not be limited to identifiers, commercial information and internet or
                other electronic network or device activity information. A more detailed description
                of the information we collect and how we use it is provided above in Section 3.
                Sections 4 and 5 describe the categories of third parties, if any, with whom we
                share personal information and what information may be shared under different
                circumstances.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are a resident of California, you have the right to request to know what
                personal information has been collected about you and to access that information.
                You also have the right to request deletion of your personal information, though
                exceptions under the CCPA may allow us to retain and use certain personal
                information notwithstanding your deletion request. You may also send your request by
                email to support@playsparlay.com. We will not discriminate against you for
                exercising your rights under the CCPA. An agent may submit a request on your behalf,
                but you must verify that your agent is authorized to do so.
              </p>
              <p>
                Separate from the CCPA, California's “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section §
                1798.83) permits users of our Site that are California residents to request certain
                information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for
                their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to
              </p>
