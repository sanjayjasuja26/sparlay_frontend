            <h4>3. THE SITE.</h4>
            <hr/>

            <h5>3.1	Peer-to-Peer Wagers</h5>
            <p>The following shall apply to both Token Wagers (entertainment only) and Cash Wagers; provided, however, that cash payments and fees apply only to Cash Wagers.</p>
            <p>Sparlay will provide a platform on which a User (a <strong>“Posting User”</strong>) can post a wager (a <strong>“Posted Wager”</strong>) and another User (an <strong>“Accepting User”</strong>) can accept a Posting User’s wager.  The amount of the wager will be established by the Posting User, subject to limits established by Sparlay including increased limits available for an additional fee (see Exhibit 1).  Posting Users can utilize betting lines and odds as provided by the Site or a Posting User can select his/her own betting lines and odds for the Posted Wager.</p>
            <p>An Accepting User may browse through all available Posted Wagers or an Accepting User may use a variety of filters to search for Posted Wagers that meet the Accepting User’s desired criteria.</p>
            <p>Upon posting a Posted Wager and before the Posted Wager becomes visible on the Site to other Users, the amount of the wager shall be deducted from the Posting User’s account and, if the balance of the Posting User’s account (cash, if a Cash Wager, or Sparlay Tokens, if it is Token Wager) is insufficient to cover the amount of the wager in the Posted Wager, the Posting User will be asked to  either deposit more cash via one of the approved methods of cash deposit indicated on the Site or purchase more tokens, as the case may be, or reduce the amount of the wager.</p>
            <p>Upon accepting a Posted Wager, the amount of the wager shall be deducted from the Accepting User’s account and, if the balance of the Accepting User’s account (cash, if a Cash Wager, or Sparlay Tokens, if it is Token Wager) is insufficient to cover the amount of the wager in the Posted Wager, the Accepting User will be asked to  either deposit more cash via one of the approved methods of cash deposit indicated on the Site or purchase more tokens, as the case may be, or select a Posted Wager with a lower wager.</p>
            <p>All money deposited with Sparlay shall be held in an escrow account by Sparlay for the benefit of the Posting User’s and Accepting User’s wagers (collectively, the <strong>“Escrowed Wagers”</strong>).  Escrowed Wagers shall not be commingled with general operating or other funds of Sparlay.  However, if and to the extent interest is earned on the Escrowed Wagers, all such interest shall be the sole property of Sparlay and none of such interest shall be allocable to either the Posting User or Accepting User.  Sparlay reserves the right to require, in its sole and absolute discretion. Additional forms of verification and confirmation of your wager.</p>
            <p>A Posting User may cancel a Posted Wager at any time prior to the Posted Wager being accepted.  Once a Posted Wager has been accepted (an “Accepted Wager”), the Accepted Wager shall be locked, and neither the Posting User nor the Accepting User may change, modify or cancel the Accepted Wager, and no refunds will be given of amounts wagered in connection with such Accepted Wager EXCEPT in the event the game or match which is the subject of the respective Accepted Wager is cancelled and/or will not be played on the date originally scheduled, in which case Sparlay will cancel the Accepted Wager, return the Escrowed Wagers to the respective Posting User and Accepting User, and thereafter such Posting User and Accepting User shall have no right, claim or interest with respect to each other or Sparlay in connection with the cancelled Accepted Wager.</p>

            <h5>3.2	Contests</h5>
            <p>Sparlay may, from time to time and in the sole discretion of Sparlay, establish wagering events which combine a number of individual Events into a single wager (each, a “Contest”).</p>
            <p>The following shall apply to both Contests in which participating Users wager only free Sparlay Tokens (each, a “Token Contest”) and Contests in which participating Users wager cash (each, a “Cash Contest”); provided, however, that cash payments and fees apply only to Cash Contests.</p>
            <p>Each Contest will, at the discretion of Sparlay, require a minimum number of Users prior to such Contest becoming effective.  A Contest may be cancelled by Sparlay at any time prior to commencement of the first Event in such Contest if the required minimum of Users has not elected to participate in such Contest.</p>
            <p>Users who desire to participate in a Contest may participate by selecting the respective Contest on the Site and, if participation is available, depositing the minimum wager (in Sparlay Tokens or cash, depending on the type of Contest).</p>
            <p>While Sparlay Tokens have no cash value, Sparlay may, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect to award one or more cash prizes in connection with a Token Contest.  If a cash prize is to be awarded in a Token Contest, it will be so indicated in the listing of Contests on the Site.</p>
